Welcome to microservices patterns workshop.
This workshop is intended to guide you through multiple microservice patterns, based on modularising a simplistic _TODO application(TM)_.

== Before we start

For sanity, when setting up a new task, start with `mvn install` with the parent `pom`

== Splitting up monoliths

There is a TODO application: two independent services talking over HTTP (REST): *todo-app* and *todo-app-ui*

=== Context

The *todo-app*(TM) is a simple TODO application built in a old-school way: EJB components with servlets and JSF sitting on a single application server (wildfly).
You can run the server with `mvn wildfly:run` and _play a bit with the app_ by browsing to http://localhost:8080/index.jsf

However, as the business evolves - the UI is planned to be replaced by a modern, JavaScript based frontend application. As a part of refactoring initiative a new front-end has be designed and implemented: `todo-app-ui`, which is a Single Page Application, with an idea to communicate with the old application through a set of REST-like HTTP calls.
The front end can be run independently by running `npm start` from *todo-app-ui* folder.

=== Task #{counter:exercise}

Based on the defined interfaces, extend the existing application and provide a set of required API.

What additional changes needs to be done to allow application to application communication, when deployed separately? How can the application still be developed separately but deployed as a monolith?

IMPORTANT: Implement the missing methods in the `TodoResource` class for the test to successfully pass.

=== How to run

The Pact is prepared by the JavaScript application. It states the expectation; what resources are expected from the provider.

It's expressed as a Pact contract created in the test phase. The pact is than passed over to provider.

The pact file is located in `todo-app/src/test/resources`. An Arquillian test is built to validate the contract (`TodoResourceProviderIT`)

The test is run as a part of Intergration Testing phase which can be triggered with Maven's `mvn clean verify`. It spins wildfly instance on pre-integration phase and stops it during post-integration phase.

TIP: The missing UI artifact `com.example.patterns:todo-app-ui` can be buld with `mvn clean install` in the todo-app-ui folder.

TIP: If you experience some nodejs issues while building the frontend application you can install it directly from file `mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.example.patterns -DartifactId=todo-app-ui -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=todo-app-ui-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` when in folder `todo-app-ui`

== API Gateway

image::tasks-banner_service.png[]

The _TODO application(TM)_ become a great success, so that business wants to monetize the business by adding commercial banners on the top of the page.

=== Context

A new service has been added to the pool: a todo page displays a commercial banner provider directly from a service owned by the marketing department.
The functionality is provided by a *banners-service* service, which is a _full stack microservice_ - provides a random image, ready to include directly onto the todo page.

=== Task #{counter:exercise}

Introduce an API gateway - a new component which hosts the UI and routes appropriate requests to services:

- `/banners/**` are forwarded to the *banners-service* (http://localhost:8081)
- `/api/**` calls are forwarded to the legacy application - *todo-app* (http://localhost:8080)

IMPORTANT: Implement the missing TODOs in `GatewayApp.java` in the *api-gateway* project

=== How to run

Run banners service with `mvn package exec:java` from *banners-service* project. The service listens on the port 8081.

Run `mvn spring-boot:run` from *api-gateway* project. The gateway listens on the port 9998.

TIP: Remember that UI has changed (new banners) so UI needs to be rebuilt. If you have problems with building the UI directly with nodejs, install the jar file again (`mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.example.patterns -DartifactId=todo-app-ui -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=todo-app-ui-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`) from `todo-app-ui` folder.
